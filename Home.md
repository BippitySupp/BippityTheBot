***

Please note, there is currently a disasterous bug present in bippitys whereby they go rogue, steal items, and hide themselves. The fact that this bug made its way into production is ludicrous, however I have implemented a workaround until an *actual dev* can step in to fix it. At the moment they go rogue, they generate a passphrase which, if messaged to them, will have them realease whatever they have taken and return to normal functionality. Sadly, they also seem to be hiding this passphrase, but it's better than nothing.
