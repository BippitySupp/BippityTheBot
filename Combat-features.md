If you happen to own a physical bippity, you may make use of its integrated defence system, to protect yourself from malicious spell casters.

# Charging
Bippitys are entirely self-powered in their movement, subsisting off of the low level magical fields that emanate from the esteemed casters to which they are bonded. If you are in the presence of hostile spell casters, your bippity will charge itself using the spells cast towards you. For each level of spell directed at you, your bippity will store 1 charge in its internal storage, up to 9 charges. Any charges over the maximum of 9 are lost.

# Counterspelling
When your Bippity has reached 9 charges, it will automatically counter the next spell cast at you by casting counterspell at 3rd level at the caster, saving you from the danger of a counterspelled counterspell. In the process, all 9 charges will be consumed. Bippitys can perform this function only once every six seconds, and are unable to upcast counterspell.
